By separating Natural and Biological into different tags, I made space for natural non-biological entities/objects **whose sound is more than just the material they're made of**. I just can't think of an example at the moment. Maybe a volcano.

## Music Info

### Function

```yaml
Percussive
	Base
	Top
	Perif
	Cym
Tonal
	Key
	Pluck
	Swell
	Stab
	Pad
Riser
Downer

Ear candy
One-shot
Loop
	Pulse
	Vocal Chop
	Break
	Fill
```

These tags roughly describe how volume changes over time, but most importantly, they define a sound's function in a song. You might recognize some of these names from preset categories in synthesizers, but some of them are more esoteric.

- Base: A kick-like sound, or anything that can be used as a (conventional or super weird) kick, even some foley can be categorized as Base
- Top: A snare/clap like sound
- Perif: Stands for "peripheral": tom-like sounds that can be used as secondary percussion. Again, a lot of foley and glitches go here
- Cym: Noisy, cymbal-like sounds: fast attack a relatively short decay
- Pad: Sustained, evolving sound with long attacks and decays
- Pulsation: Tremolo-like
- Pluck/Key: Fast attack and medium decay, but for pitched sounds
- Texture: No distinctive elements, can be easily used as a layer for other sounds
- Ear candy: Foley/designed sounds to use as filler

### Tonality

```yaml
Polyphony
	Monophonic
	Polyphonic
		Major chord
		Minor chord
		Augmented
		Diminished
		Extended
Scale
    Major scale
    Minor scale
Root
    C
    C#/Db
    D
#   ...
    B
```

These tags are very useful for finding material to feed granular synths with. If I want anything pitched, the "Tonality" tag is often enough, or a specific scale and root if I'm doing it in the context of a song. In fact, scale tags should be used *only* for melodies and chord progressions. It wouldn't make sense to tag a sample containing a single chord with a specific scale, since that chord can be used in multiple scales.

- Root tags can be used to define:
	- the root of the scale of a **melody, chord progression, or full song**
	- the note of a **single-note sample**
	- the root of the chord of a **single-chord sample**
- If using both Scale, Chord, and Root tags simultaneously (e.g. to tag a song in D minor with the chords Dm, Bb, and C), the root tag should be interpreted as the root of the *scale*, **not the root of any of the chords**, so in this case the root tag would be "D", not Bb nor C. In total, only these tags must be used:
	- D (Root)
	- Minor scale
	- Major chord
	- Minor chord
- This also applies for melodies. For example, a melody in D minor with notes D, F, and A must have *only* the following tags:
	- D (Root)
	- Minor scale

In the future, I envision encoding more specific music information (such as all notes and chords played in the file) as some sort of metadata.

I might add tags for microtonal music in the future.

I use these tags to further describe speech and lyrics in terms of the actual ideas being transmitted. Sentiment tags can also be used to describe certain non-speech sounds based on your own perception.
