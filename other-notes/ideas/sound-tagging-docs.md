Some of these tags are very useful for finding material to feed granular synths with. If I want anything pitched, the Polyphony tag is often enough, or a specific Scale and Root if I'm doing it in the context of a song. I also use Root for setting a single note's pitch (useful with the One-Shot tag).

The Envelope tags roughly describe how volume changes over time, but most importantly, they define a sound's function in a song. You might recognize some of these names from preset categories in synthesizers, but some of them are more esoteric.

- Base: A kick-like sound, or anything that can be used as a (conventional or super weird) kick, even some foley can be categorized as Base
- Top: A snare/clap like sound
- Perif: Stands for "peripheral": tom-like sounds that can be used as secondary percussion. Again, a lot of foley and glitches go here
- Cym: Noisy, cymbal-like sounds: fast attack a relatively short decay
- Pad: Sustained, evolving sound with long attacks and decays
- Pulsation: Tremolo-like
- Pluck/Key: Fast attack and medium decay, but for pitched sounds
- Texture: No distinctive elements, can be easily used as a layer for other sounds
- Earcandy: Foley/designed sounds to use as filler

I might add tags for microtonal music, but it's not a priority currently.

I use these tags to further describe speech and lyrics in terms of the actual ideas being transmitted. Sentiment tags can also be used to describe certain non-speech sounds based on your own perception.

These tags respond to a more "meta" version of the question "What is this sound?". It even opens the possibility of non-audio entries like presets or effect chains. I still need to work on that though.

Some clarifications:

- Render: Any piece of music that comes out of a DAW, finished or not
- Stem: Rendered group of instruments
- Track: Full song
