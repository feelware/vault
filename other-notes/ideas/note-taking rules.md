# note-taking rules

- prioritize reading over writing
- notes should represent the main takeaways of a section: what matters to you
- some details will be inevitably lost
- sections shouldn't be too granular, triple-headings are a good rule of thumb
- write down *only* what you understood
	- put `#wip` next to a note when you don't understand a particular section after reading through it a couple of times
- don't obsess over making your notes look "publishing-ready"
