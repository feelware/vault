> So everyone you ask for advice will tell you there's "no wrong way to write a song". That's true, but I don't think it's the advice you need. So here's my much more constrained approach, my recipe for a nice song:
> 
> ## Chords
> 
> Now at the core, most songs boil down to two key elements: a vocal tune and chords. Let's talk about chords first.
> 
> Em - D - C - G
> 
> For now, don't worry about any chords other than those. You can put them together in any order you want. You can use all 4, or any 3, or even just 2 if you like. Once you have a progression, play it slowly, over and over. You'll probably stay in 4/4 time, so your chord loop might take 4, 8 or 16 bars of drumming. You can embellish these chords plenty; using tricks like incorporating little hammerons, or experimenting with adding other notes into the chords for flavour (this will be much easier after you learn some theory)

> ## Structure
> 
> You can't go wrong with the classic verse-chorus-verse-chorus-chorus-end
> 
> Once you have that down, you can start experimenting with stuff like intros, bridges, prechoruses and other fancy things. The chorus should be the catchiest bit of the song, and probably the bit it feels most natural to play and sing a bit louder. The verse should sorta build up towards the chorus, if possible. The two most important bits you need are a verse, and a chorus. They should sound different from each other, but they should still sound like part of one contained song.

> ## Lyrics
> 
> Incorporating lyrics to music
> 
> So remember a few paragraphs ago, I talked about a loop that goes round and around forever, taking 16 toe taps each time? Let's imaging that I have one, and it goes EM - EM - D - C
> 
> Get that loop going, and sorta talk-sing your lyrics over it. Find the stresses in your lines, feel out the syllabic runs. Use your intuition and creativity to let a melody grow out of the words, over the chords. You may want to rejig the lyrics if they aren't quite fitting right.
> 
> You might use different chords for the chorus, but you don't have to. It's important to make the vocals have a different vocal melody from the verse, the chorus should stand out from the rest of the song.
> 
> **Note**
> 
> There's millions of ways to write a song. The method above won't get you the most Avant Garde, groundbreaking piece of music, but it will reliably give you a catchy, enjoyable template to express your creativity.
> 
> Here's my standard advice on lyrics:
> 
> - Play with idioms. Take a common saying and twist it. Cloud with a silver bullet, wolves in wolves' clothing, that kinda thing. It won't write a whole song for you, but it will help give you some cool phrases to sprinkle through.
>     
> - rhyming couplets are always a safe choice. That said, beware of using 'forced rhymes', where the listener can tell you chose a word just to fit the rhyme scheme instead of for its meaning. Ideally, you're looking for words that say what you want to say, and _just happen_ to rhyme
>     
> - Multisyllabic rhyme. It makes your words sound better to the ear, regardless of what they mean. It's a cool feature to include if you can. If you're doing anything related to rap, you 100% need to know your way around multisylbic rhyme. For other genres it's optional.
>     
> - (This next one is probably the biggest one for a lot of people on this sub) Show, don't tell. Don't say he's depressed, say he's eating raw cookie dough in his room at 3am. Don't say she's beautiful, say her hair bounces around her frame with every step she takes. It's important not to tell the audience what they are supposed to feel about what they hear: instead, just give us the details and we'll reach that feeling ourselves. Specificity is incredibly powerful.
>     
> - Think about structure. Generally, your chorus should sorta 'sum up' your song, while your verses should each explore different aspects of the topic. Perhaps your verses function a bit like chapters of a story. Perhaps as the song progresses, someone's perspective changes, something gets realised, something comes full circle by the end of the song. Maybe each verse has a callback to previous verses, some kind of lyrical echo that occurs in the same part of each verse
>     
> - Confidence. Even if your lyrics are utter crap, just pretend they're great. Completely commit to them, sing them like you believe every word you're saying and only an idiot wouldn't realise how good your lyrics are. You might be amazed how many people you can fool
