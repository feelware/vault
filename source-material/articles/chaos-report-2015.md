# Chaos Report 2015

Bridges, unlike software products, are built on-time and on-budget, and usually don't fall

When bridges fall, the cause of failure is investigated and documented, unlike software failures, which are usually covered up, ignored, or rationalized

The CHAOS report focuses on identifying:
- the scope of software project failures
- major factors that cause software projects to fail
- key ingredients that can reduce project failures

 Original resolution definition: on-time, on-budget, **on-target**
 New definition: on-time, on-budget, **with a satisfactory result**

New definition is more flexible:
- Project target can evolve
- Customer/user satisfaction is prioritized over fulfillment of requirements
