# Starting from scratch

## Start with a feature, not a layout

- An app is essentially a collection of features.
- The layout is just the *shell*.
- You should not ponder on the layout before you know what your app will do.
- Start with a central feature. Lay down the **elements necessary to make it work**. Then, build around it, adding elements as needed.
- The layout might end up a lot simpler than you thought.

## Detail comes later

- Low-level details like typefaces, shadows, and icons shouldn't be your first concern.
- Tip: Start designing on paper with a thick marker. This will force you to focus on the layout without getting bogged down in details.

### Hold the color

- Start by designing in grayscale.
- Let the spacing, contrast, and size do the heavy lifting.
- Might be challenging, but will result in a clearer hierarchy you can later enhance with color.

### Don't over invest

- Don't spend too much time on mockups and wireframes. They're disposable.
- Use them to explore ideas fast. Start building the real thing as soon as possible.

## Don't design too much

- Don't obsess with figuring out every possible state and scenario in the design phase.

### Work in cycles

- It's easier to catch design issues by actually using the app than by relying on your imagination.
- Design a simple version of your feature. Implement it. Use it. Refine it until there are no more issues.
- Then, move on to the next feature.

### Be a pessimist

- When designing, don't add features so readily. They might be harder to implement than you think.
- Design the smallest useful version of your feature first, leaving the "nice-to-have" for later".
- This way, you'll always have something to fall back on.

## Choose a personality

### Font choice

- For an elegant or classic look, choose a serif font.
- For a playful look, choose a rounded sans-serif font.
- For a plainer look, choose a neutral sans-serif font.
