# 19.2.5 Deadlock

## Transfer Scenario

- A deadlock occurs when multiple processes depend on each other to continue execution.
- Suppose a transfer operation that locks access to the debited and credited accounts in order.

- Suppose two simultaneous transfer:
	- $T1$ from account 6005 to 6004
	- $T2$ from account 6004 to 6005
- Suppose that the first LOC in both transfers succeed: $T1$ locks access to 6005 and $T2$ locks access to 6004.
- Following the second LOC, $T1$ will wait until 6004's lock is released by $T2$, its current holder.
- Similarly, $T2$ will wait until 6005's lock is released by $T1$.
- $T2$ won't continue until $T1$ releases 6005, which will happen only after $T1$ completes, which requires $T2$ to release 6004, which will happen only after $T2$ completes.

## Solution: global ordering

- We must establish a global ordering among shared resources, such that all processes that request them do so in order. This prevents deadlocks.
- In the previous example, the transfer first acquires access to the debited account and then the debited.
- Instead, we should make it first acquire the lower-numbered account, and then higher-numbered account. 
- This will make $T1$ and $T2$ try to acquire 6004 right away, whichever comes first will make the other wait until completion.
