# The darker side of making music

- good art is about delivering an idea with conviction
- there's always gonna be people that like your style, or at least believe in its potential
- you have the final choice on how to define success, but the purest way of defining it is finding joy, fulfillment, and immersion in the process
- be consistent, trust the failures
- remember that one day you will die
