# # The Skill of Learning from Lectures

- most of the learning happens before and after the lecture
- popularity of lectures has more to do with economics and tradition than its effectiveness
- you should come prepared to the lecture
- coming prepared is like planting seeds that the lecture waters
- when running out of time with a reading assignment, it's better to read a portion *deeply* than rushing through the whole thing
- some of the benefits of coming prepared to the lecture are:
  - reducing cognitive load during the lecture (so you're not overwhelmed by vast amount of new ideas)
  - creating "terrain" that new ideas can hook into (during or even after the lecture)
  - get practice that the theoretical knowledge from lectures can blend with
- coming prepared will make the content more relevant and, in consequence, improve your attention
- a good way of reviewing the material post-lecture is free recall
- don't avoid reviewing stuff that you *think* you've already seen
- first weeks of class are really important, as they teach fundamental concepts everything else will build upon
- make minimal notes. there's no evidence that suggests taking notes during lectures improves learning
