# Don't get ahead of yourself in math courses in college. Treat it like a musical instrument.

- You *need* to know algebra very well in order to do good in calculus.
- Math majors are trained to understand math as a language. A good portion of the math you might learn in a math major isn't directly applicable to physics or engineering.
- Engineers don't need to understand all of mathematics to communicate, the same way everyday people don't need to fully understand their own language to communicate with their friends and family.

> Watching someone like me do a whole bunch of math equations and all this stuff that I'm doing is not impressive. Someone who takes snippets of that math and goes out and does an invention that saves somebody's life, that is impressive. I'm nothing more than like an English professor, just for math. [...] (As an engineer) your job is not to become a mathematician, your job is to know **enough math to apply it**.

- If you're desperate to become a master right off the bat, you might be craving **glory** rather than true, committed mastery.
- Some musicians prefer to skip theory and general practice when learning an instrument, instead focusing on "learning" popular songs so they can play it from memory, with the final goal of **impressing people**.

> "I want to be able to say I can do calculus", to an unsuspecting citizen that may sound impressive, but what they're going to say is "wow, this is an arrogant douche".

- Getting good at something will get people to envy you.
- If you want to truly excel at something, you need to be patient and go through all the steps. This applies to music, math, and almost everything.
- You should spend more time mastering the fundamentals (algebra and trigonometry) before jumping into advanced topics. In some way, algebra and trigonometry are the true advanced courses, and you should spend more time mastering these.

> The number one reason students do bad in calculus is because their algebra is weak. You rush through algebra, you ace it because it's simple, but you don't understand *why* it's simple, [...] and that's why you fail at calculus.
