# Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design

## Introduction

- UX means how an user feels when consuming a particular good or service
- Usability means ease of use
- A product has good UX if it's usable, equitable, enjoyable and useful

### Common UX roles

#### Design

- Interaction designer: User flow across the entire app (not much into aesthetics)
- Visual designer: Digital assets (icons, illustrations, etc.)
- Motion designer
- Graphic designer: Print assets and other mediums (posters, etc.)
- UX designer: #wip

#### Design-adjacent

- UX researcher: Explores user behavior and existing products
- UX writer: Descriptions, captions, button labels, etc.
- Production designer: Makes sure final design is ready to be handed off to developers
- UX engineer: Makes sure designs are feasible to implement
- UX program manager: Communication between roles

#### How company size affects work

- Startups: Since they have few employees, you end up being a **generalist**, which is a useful learning experience, but can be stressful.
- Big companies: **Specialized** work. Hard to get outside your specialty.

## The product development life cycle

### Brainstorming

Acquire rough insights about the problem we want to solve, the people that face this problem, and existing solutions to the problem.

### Define

Write down the exact specifications/requirements of the product: Who exactly is gonna use it? What will the product do? What will it *not* do?

### Design

Make prototypes, wireframes, and other design artifacts.

### Test

Run tests within your company (alpha testing), with stakeholders (so that the product aligns with the company's goals), and with potential users (beta testing). Go back to [design](#Design) if necessary.

### Launch

Deploy the product. Digital products might gather feedback even after deploying.


## Designing for different devices

- **Users behave differently depending on their device**
- Start designing for the platform your users are more likely to use your product on
- Have a clear brand image so your product has the same look-and-feel no matter the platform
- Mobile usage sessions are almost half as short as desktop usage sessions
- **Reflect on your own behaviors when using these platforms**
- Take account of low-end devices and slow/unreliable Internet connectivity

### Tips for mobile UX design

- CTA buttons should be front and clear
- Navigation menus should list only the core parts of a website
- Make use of gestures users are familiar with, like tapping, swiping, or **scrolling**
- Consider both portrait and landscape views
- **Reduce clutter**, make every element count

## User-centered design

- Design framework
- Similar structure to [the product development life cycle](#The%20product%20development%20life%20cycle). They're both iterative

### Steps

1. **Understand** the end users
2. **Specify** which of their problems you want to solve
3. **Design** and implement your solution
4. **Test** your product with your end users

### What to take account of?

- Disabilities, either temporary, situational or permanent
- Digital literacy, don't assume everyone is familiar with patterns like call-to-actions, icons, or touchscreen gestures
- Internet connection quality
- Preferred language, both for reading and typing

### Universal design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design

- Universal design: A single design for all users
- Inclusive design: Taking account of particularities of certain user groups
- Equity-focused: Focusing on historically underrepresented user groups

## Design thinking

### Phases

- **Empathize** with potential users about their needs
- **Define** the problem statement
- **Ideate** possible solutions to those issues
- **Prototype** solutions
- **Test** solutions with users

## Design sprints

| Design thinking         | Design sprint   |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Framework or philosophy | Precise process |
| Overarching             | Time-bound      |

### Phases

- **Understand** the scope of the problem to solve
- **Ideate** possible solutions in the form of wireframes, sketches, and even words
- **Decide** on the most viable solution
- **Prototype** that solution
- **Test** the prototype with end users

### Sprint brief

Document describing, among many things:

- The project's background
- The sprint's objectives
- Who's in charge of approving designs
- The sprint's rules

It helps attendees prepare for the sprint.

### Sprint retrospective

- Was the required work underestimated or overestimated?
- Did an external factor derail productivity?
- Does the final design solve the user problem?

> **Groupthink** can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic.

Sharing thoughts anonymously during a sprint retrospective reduces the chance of groupthinking and causing offense. 

Before starting a sprint, review the latest sprint retrospective.

## UX research

- What users actually want over what companies *believe* users want
- In large companies, it's usual for each UX designer to have a UX research partner

### Phases of UX research

- Foundational research: What are the user problems and how to solve them
- Design research: How to solve those problems
- Post-launch research: Did we solve the problem?

### Types of UX research

- Qualitative and quantitative
- Primary (interacting with real users) and secondary (previous studies)

### Research methods

- Interviews (in-depth feedback)
- Surveys (cheap, larger samples)
- Usability tests (feedback on your actual app)

### Biases

#### Confirmation bias

- Focusing on evidence of your own beliefs
- To overcome:
	- Don't word your interview questions to make the answers please you
	- Prefer open-ended questions rather than multiple-choice questions
	- Keep a neutral body language and tone of voice
	- Don't interrupt users while they're using your app

#### Primacy and recency biases

- Focusing on the first and last thing the interviewees mentioned, respectively
- To overcome: Document interviews either by taking notes or recording them 

#### Sunk cost fallacy

- Insist on finishing something because you already invested a lot on it
- To overcome: Set "checkpoints" where you can freely decided whether to continue or stop
