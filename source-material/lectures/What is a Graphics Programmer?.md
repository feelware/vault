# What is a Graphics Programmer?

- A graphics programmer makes Blender
- A technical artist makes stuff for Blender

| Role                      | Math    | Compsci    | Art     | Job                   | Specialization     |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Graphics programmer**   | Maximum | Maximum    | Some    | Invents the tools     | Specialist         |
| **Technical artist**      | Medium  | Medium     | Medium  | Makes tools accesible | Jack of all trades |
| **General shader artist** | Minimal | No compsci | Maximum | Uses the tools        | Specialist         |
## Recommendations

- Go to college for computer science
- Minor in math (or take elective courses)
- A compsci class on computer graphics won't be enough for the industry
- OpenGL isn't that valuable anymore (note: https://learnopengl.com/)

> You can take as long as you want to get anywhere, as long as you get there eventually.

- Unreal is mostly meant for artists who want a complete and reliable package of functionality
- Godot is at a very incipient stage. Not recommended for beginners
- Learn the fundamentals in Unity. Check [these tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) before transitioning to Godot or making your own graphics engine. Writing shaders in Unity is really easy
- After that, check [Rastertek's DX tutorials](https://www.rastertek.com/tutindex.html). Having worked with graphics API is necessary in your portfolio
- There are *very* few intermediate resources
- Read research papers. It *is* necessary and very valuable. You don't have to be really smart to do it, you might have to read them many times over to understand
- Read [Real-time rendering. 4th edition](../textbooks/pdf/real-time-rendering.pdf)
- Read the [GPU gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/contributors) collection
- Apply the things you learn. Intentionally break your code. Implement papers. Solve problems you thought of yourself

> No one expects you to know it all, but to demonstrate that you *could* learn it all if needed

- Acerola's Furry Challenge is a good project for beginners
